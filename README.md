## Hi there 👋

I’m Millicent, a Software engineer based in Lagos.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is Python, Solidity, react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion.

I’ve built over tons of public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than alot at this point.


Fun Facts:
I love maths
I don’t like coffee.
Hobbies: reading, gym, building things
